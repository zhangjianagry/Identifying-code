# Identifying-code
keras for indentifying captures

usage:
1. run the generatePic.py, you will get the pics in the pic direction.
    you can set the number of pics which are generated.
2. run the pic2numpy.py, you will get x.npy, y.npy from the pic direction.
3. run the cnn.py, you can get the model for identifying captures.




The accurate is just 60%,so there is something to be done:

1.I only use the 10000 pics, so maybe it's need more pics.
2.The architecture for cnn may can be adjusted.
3.There are also some problems in the cnn.py, need to fix it.
